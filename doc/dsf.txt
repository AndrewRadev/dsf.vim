INSTALLATION                                                  *dsf-installation*

The easiest way to install the plugin is with a plugin manager:

- vim-plug: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
- Vundle:   https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim

If you use one, just follow the instructions in its documentation.

You can install the plugin yourself using Vim's |packages| functionality by
cloning the project (or adding it as a submodule) under
`~/.vim/pack/<any-name>/start/`. For example:
>
    git clone https://github.com/AndrewRadev/dsf.vim ~/.vim/pack/_/start/dsf
<
This should automatically load the plugin for you on Vim start. Alternatively,
you can add it to `~/.vim/pack/<any-name>/opt/` instead and load it in your
.vimrc manually with:
>
    packadd dsf
<
If you'd rather not use git, you can download the files from the "releases"
tab and unzip them in the relevant directory:
https://github.com/AndrewRadev/dsf.vim/releases.

USAGE                                                                *dsf-usage*

The plugin defines a mapping to delete a surrounding function call (or
something similar to one), even if it happens to be namespaced. Some examples:
>
    nested(function_call(cursor_here))   -> nested(cursor_here)
    nested(cursor_here(chewy_center))    -> cursor_here(chewy_center)
    One::Two.new([cursor_here])          -> [cursor_here]
    One::Two.new(Hash[cursor_here])      -> One::Two.new(cursor_here)
    SomeStruct{cursor_here: "Something"} -> cursor_here: "Something"
<
By pressing `dsf` (which stands for "delete surrounding function call") with
the cursor on `cursor_here`, you get the result on the right.

More mappings ~

The plugin defines `csf` to "change surrounding function call", which deletes
only the function itself and leaves the cursor waiting to enter a new name.

For convenience, the `dsnf` (the "n" standing for "next") mapping will look
for a function call after the cursor to delete:
>
    var result = function_call(foo, bar(baz));
    // With the cursor on "foo", pressing dsnf results in:
    var result = function_call(foo, baz);
<
Text objects ~

The text objects for `if` and `af` manipulate function calls with their
contents. Given this example:
>
    var result = function_call(one, two);
<
Typing `daf` ("a function call") with the cursor anywhere on
`function_call(one, two)` would result in:
>
    var result = ;
<
Typing `dif` ("inner function call") with the cursor anywhere on
`function_call(one, two)` would result in:
>
    var result = function_call();
<
To learn more about how text objects work, try the `:help` for |text-objects|.

Multiline ~

The plugin also works on multiline function calls, for example:
>
    foo = one(
      two
    )

    foo = two
<
The insides of the function will be automatically indented using the |=|
operator to compensate for any potential changes in indentation level.

Customization ~

If you'd like to set your own mappings, instead of using the built-ins, simply
set the variable `g:dsf_no_mappings` to `1` and use the <Plug> mappings
provided by the plugin:
>
    let g:dsf_no_mappings = 1

    nmap dsf <Plug>DsfDelete
    nmap csf <Plug>DsfChange

    nmap dsnf <Plug>DsfNextDelete
    nmap csnf <Plug>DsfNextChange

    omap af <Plug>DsfTextObjectA
    xmap af <Plug>DsfTextObjectA
    omap if <Plug>DsfTextObjectI
    xmap if <Plug>DsfTextObjectI
<
Change any of the left-hand sides of the `map` calls to whatever you'd like,
or remove lines to leave them unset.

For additional settings check the below section, |dsf-settings|.


==============================================================================
SETTINGS                                                          *dsf-settings*

                                                             *g:dsf_no_mappings*
>
    let g:dsf_no_mappings = 1
<

Default value: 0

If you set this variable to 1, the plugin will not define any default
mappings. You'll still have the <Plug> maps provided to you that you can map
any keys you want to. Check |dsf-usage| for details on that.

                                                                *g:dsf_brackets*
>
    let g:dsf_brackets = '('
<

Default value: '([{'

You can change this value to determine what brackets identify a "function
call". While in most languages, only "(" is used for those, a useful (even if
technically incorrect) interpretation of "function call" might include things
like `Hash[*some_list]` in ruby, or `SomeStruct{with: "values"}` in go. This
is why the plugin, by default, considers "([{" as brackets.

If you'd like to avoid this, so you don't accidentally delete structs or
something, set this to whatever opening brackets you'd like to detect.

Note that this can be changed per-buffer by setting `b:dsf_brackets`.

                                                        *g:dsf_function_pattern*
>
    let g:dsf_function_pattern = '\k\+'
<

Default value: '\k\+[?!]\='

The function pattern determines what will be identified as a function name.
This should not include the opening bracket. Usually, a keyword character will
do the trick, but the default also adds some extra characters allowed at the
end to cover special cases for ruby.

The pattern is a Vim regex, if you need more information on those, check the
:help on |pattern-overview|.

Note that this can be changed per-buffer by setting `b:dsf_function_pattern`.

                                                       *g:dsf_namespace_pattern*
>
    let g:dsf_namespace_pattern = '\k\+::'
<

Default value: '\k\+\%(\.\|::\|:\|#\)'

The namespace pattern determines what will be identified as a namespace that
prefixes a function. This will likely be a set of keyword characters, followed
by something like "::", ".", depending on the language. The default includes a
set of characters that cover a few languages.

If you'd like to NOT cover namespaces at all, and just manipulate the function
name, set it to the empty string:
>
    let g:namespace_pattern = ''
<
This might allow you, to, for example, easily change the function call with
`csf` to a different one in the same module/package.

The pattern is a Vim regex, if you need more information on those, check the
:help on |pattern-overview|.

Note that this can be changed per-buffer by setting `b:dsf_namespace_pattern`.
